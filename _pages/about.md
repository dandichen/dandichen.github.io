I am a third-year PhD student in [Population Health](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/degree-programs/about-the-programs/population-health/) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My advisor is Dr. [Maureen Smith](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/smith-maureen/). I explore the association between telehealth use and unplanned events during COVID-19 and multilevel factors that may improve colorectal cancer screening rates at rural and urban clinics in Wisconsin, by working closely with Dr. [Jessica Cao](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/cao-jessica-ying/), Dr. [Jennifer Weiss](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/565/Weiss_Jennifer), and Dr. [Guanhua Chen](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/).

I was trained in computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. I got my master's degrees in Biomedical Data Science and Computer Science from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) and [University of Connecticut](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/), respectively. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/).

I am interested in trustworthy machine learning in healthcare. I would like to know if causal inference can help better understand machine learning models when focusing on health services research and clinical problems. With causal inference embedded, these black-box models may become more interpretable and generalizable, rather than being limited to finding patterns in the data.
