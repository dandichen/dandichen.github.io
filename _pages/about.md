I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Population Health](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/degree-programs/about-the-programs/population-health/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My advisor is Dr.[Maureen Smith](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/smith-maureen/). I also work closely with Dr.[Jessia Cao](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/cao-jessica-ying/), Dr.[Jennifer Weiss](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/565/Weiss_Jennifer), and Dr.[Guanhuan Chen](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/) exploring association between telehealth use and unplanned events during COVID-19 and identifying multi-level factors to increase colorectal cancer screening rates in Wisconsin clinics.  

I was trained in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I received my Master's degrees in Biomedical Data Science and Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) and the [University of Connecticut](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/). My Bachelor's degree was in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
