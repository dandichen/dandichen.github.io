I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Population Health](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/degree-programs/about-the-programs/population-health/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My advisor is Dr.[Maureen Smith](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/smith-maureen/). I also work closely with Dr.[Jessia Cao](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/cao-jessica-ying/), Dr.[Jennifer Weiss](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/565/Weiss_Jennifer), and Dr.[Guanhuan Chen](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/) to explore the association between telehealth use and unplanned events during COVID-19 and multilevel factors that may improve colorectal cancer screening rates at rural and urban clinics in Wisconsin.  

I was trained in computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. I received my Master's degrees in Biomedical Data Science and Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) and the [University of Connecticut](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/). My Bachelor's degree was in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/).

I would like to know if if causal inference can help better understand machine learning models when focusing on health services research and clinical problems. With causal inference embedded, those black box models might be easier to understand with domain knowledge.
